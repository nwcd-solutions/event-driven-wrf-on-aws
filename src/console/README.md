## Getting Started - Creating the React Application

To get started, we first need to create a new React project & change into the new directory using the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you already have this installed, skip to the next step. If not, either install the CLI & create the app or create a new app using npx:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-amplify-app --template typescript
```

Or use npx (npm 5.2 & later) to create a new app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-amplify-app
```

Now change into the new app directory & install the AWS Amplify & AWS Amplify React libraries:

```bash
cd my-amplify-app
npm install --save aws-amplify aws-amplify-react uuid
# or
yarn add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react uuid
```
