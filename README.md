# Event Driven WRF on AWS
![Overview image](./img/arch.png)

A fully automated cloud-native event driven weather forecasting.
For HPC6a instance only available in us-east-2, you should deploy the solution in this region.

## Prerequisites
1. Create an EC2 Key pair with name us-east-2.
2. Create S3 bucket to host input files of each domain that necessary for WRF running and the output files ,the structure should like belowing:
```
---my-bucket-name
    |---inputs
    |       |---domain_1
    |       |       |---namelist.wps
    |       |       |---namelist.input
    |       |---domain_2
    |               |---namelist.wps
    |               |---namelist.input
    |---outputs
```  
## Installation

Install the AWS CDK application and the python library.

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
cd src/
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Deploying

Create a lambda layer that contains `requests` and `pyyaml`.
```
cd layer
pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/
zip -r ../layer.zip python
cd ..
```

Then deploy the CDK stack. Note: you must specify a bucket where you want the
forecast output uploaded to, in the following example I am using
`my-bucket-name`.

```
cdk bootstrap
cdk deploy --parameters BucketName=my-bucket-name
```

## Cleanup

To completely tear down all infrastructure when it is not needed.

```
cdk destroy --all
```
